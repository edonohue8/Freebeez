# USER STORY

## Freebeez App

AS someone considering to do away with items I don’t want

I WANT to be able to post those items for others to communicate interest 

SO THAT I will be able to successfully communicate with interested parties and ultimately give those items away

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

GIVEN I am trying to post items I’m considering doing away with

WHEN I enter those product details into the application (i.e. item name, item type, contact info, and description of the item)

THEN I am able to see those items posted accordingly so interested parties can contact me and discuss how to arrange drop-off/pick-up of the item

## Description 

For our second project, we created a website application called Freebeez that lets users post items they would like to do away with.  Our goal for Freebeez is to build a network connecting the item poster with interested parties with a fun bee theme!

As the user approaches the landing page, he/she will be able to view items already posted and available.  After registering an account and logging in, the user will be able to view the item poster’s contact information to communicate interest.

## Challenges

In regards to our new technology aspect, we used gulp-uglify (https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-uglify).  However, this only worked when running our node server locally.  When deployment was pushed to Heroku, there were connection issues.
